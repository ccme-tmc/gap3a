# GAP: **G**W for **A**ugmented **P**lanewaves

All-electron GW and CRPA calculator as an interface to [WIEN2k](http://susi.theochem.tuwien.ac.at/)

## Installation 

`TODO`: OLD version!

To compile gwx
1. modify "make.inc" according to the target system    
     The templates for the following architectures have been provided
          Linux 
          SunOS
          AIX 
2. setup the LAPACK and BLAS library in make.inc 
3. first generate the sequential version by
```bash
$ make seq    
```
    and then parallel version 
```bash
$ make para   # only subroutines related to parallelization are recompiled
```
    By default, the excutables for the sequential and parallel version are `gap${version}.x` and  `gap${version}-mpi.x`, respectively
4. Modify the alias AWK in init_gwx if necessary (as on SunOS) 
   In some systems like SunOS, awk does not support -v < variable = value > but nawk does. 
   In that case, one should change alias for awk in init_gwx 


## Usage 

`TODO`: OLD version!

   1. Run a full SCF calculation using WIEN2K 

   2. Prepare gw input files by running the shell script 

          init_gws<VERSION> -f <casename> -d <gwdir> -nkp <number of kpoints for gw>  ......

     gwdir is the working diretory for gw calculation. It is recommended that gwdir be different 
     from the working directory for scf. 
     More detailed information about the options for init_gws can be got by 

          init_gws<VERSION> -h 

   3. Modify <gwdir>/$file.ingw if necessary 


   4. Run 

          gws<VERSION> 

     or 

          gws<VERSION>-mpi (using mpirun) 

    in the gwdir. 

   5. To restart a gw calculation, set in the $file.ingw
```bash
  Restart = T
```
     otherwise it always starts from the beginning no matter whether $file.selfx/e exist or not.    


Changes for the input: 
   1. The range of bands for which GW quasiparticle energies are calculated 
      is now controled by 
```bash
  emingw = <-2.0 / Ry.>  
  emaxgw = <2.0  / Ry.>
```
     Only states whose LDA energies falls between E_Fermi+emingw and 
     E_Fermi+emaxgw are calculated. To be compatible with previous versions, 
    one can also use 
       ibgw = <1>
       nbgw = <nomax+nexban>   
    to indicate the indices of the lowest and highest band that are calculated.

   2. The input block for 'Selfenergy' has changes. So one has to 
       change this block if one wants to use this version of the code to continue 
       previous calculations initiated by old versions. 
```bash
  %Selfenergy 
   <Np>  |   <iopes>   |   <iopac>               
  %
```
       Please check a ingw sample generated by init_gws to know the meaning of each term.
