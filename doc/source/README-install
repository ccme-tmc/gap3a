  To compile gwx
   (1) modify "make.inc" according to the target system    
       The templates for the following architectures have been provided
            Linux 
            SunOS
            AIX 

   (2) setup the LAPACK and BLAS library in make.inc 

   (3)  first generate the sequential version 
          make seq    
      and then parallel version 
          make para   (only subroutines related to parallelization are recompiled) 
      By default, the excutables for the sequential and parallel version are 
          gap2.x
      and 
          gap2-mpi.x  
      

   (4) Modify the alias AWK in init_gwx if necessary (as on SunOS) 
       In some systems like SunOS, awk does not support -v < variable = value > but nawk does. 
       In that case, one should change alias for awk in init_gwx
