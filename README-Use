#                                Using gws                                    #
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

   (1) Run a full SCF calculation using WIEN2K 

   (2) Prepare gw input files by running the shell script 

           init_gws<VERSION> -f <casename> -d <gwdir> -nkp <number of kpoints for gw>  ......

      gwdir is the working diretory for gw calculation. It is recommended that gwdir be different 
      from the working directory for scf. 
      More detailed information about the options for init_gws can be got by 

           init_gws<VERSION> -h 

   (3) Modify <gwdir>/$file.ingw if necessary 


   (4) Run 

           gws<VERSION> 

      or 

           gws<VERSION>-mpi (using mpirun) 

     in the gwdir. 

   (5) To restart a gw calculation, set in the $file.ingw

        Restart = T

     otherwise it always starts from the beginning no matter whether $file.selfx/e exist or not.    


Changes for the input: 
   (1) The range of bands for which GW quasiparticle energies are calculated 
       is now controled by 

         emingw = <-2.0 / Ry.>  
         emaxgw = <2.0  / Ry.>

      Only states whose LDA energies falls between E_Fermi+emingw and 
      E_Fermi+emaxgw are calculated. To be compatible with previous versions, 
     one can also use 
        ibgw = <1>
        nbgw = <nomax+nexban>   
     to indicate the indices of the lowest and highest band that are calculated.

   (2) The input block for 'Selfenergy' has changes. So one has to 
       change this block if one wants to use this version of the code to continue 
       previous calculations initiated by old versions. 

       %Selfenergy 
        <Np>  |   <iopes>   |   <iopac>               
       %

       Please check a ingw sample generated by init_gws to know the meaning of each term.
